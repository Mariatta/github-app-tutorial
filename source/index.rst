Welcoming Contributions to Your Project
---------------------------------------

In this tutorial we'll be building a GitHub bot that will automatically
greet contributors to your project. The bot will be built as a GitHub App which
can then be installed to your GitHub repositories.

We will be building a GitHub bot that can:

- say thanks to the maintainer who installed your bot

- say thanks to new contributors who made pull requests to your repository

About me
--------

My name is Mariatta. I live in Vancouver, Canada where I work as a Software Engineer
for Zapier. In my free time, I help with PyLadies globally and locally in Vancouver,
I'm one of the co-founders of PyCascades conference, and I also contribute to open source.

I'm a Python Core Developer. I help maintain Core Python's GitHub bots:
`bedevere <https://github.com/python/bedevere>`_ and
`miss-islington <https://github.com/miss-islington>`_.

In this tutorial, we'll be using the same tools and technologies used by Core Python's
team to build their bots.
